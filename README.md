# basicWeaponsMod
**Basic Weapons Mod** for Minecraft

*Minecraft version 1.7.10*

*Forge version 1.7.10-10.13.4.1558*

## Info
Everything can be crafted, except for ammunition and the 12x scope.
The Weapon Workbench is still a work in progress, and will later be used to craft guns out of gun parts (receiver, barrel, etc.)
Guns are very overpowered right now, as they currently don't use ammo.

## To Do
* Add Lead ore for crafing bullets
* Add crafting recipes for ammunition and 12x scope
* Add scope functionality
* Add functionality to Weapon Workbench
* *LOTS of other stuff...*
